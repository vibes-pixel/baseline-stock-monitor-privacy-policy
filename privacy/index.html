**Baseline Stock Monitor**

Baseline Stock Monitor is an app designed to help merchants manually identify and track products that reach zero stock inside their store.

---

## Data Access

The app accesses the following store data through the Shopify Admin API:

* Product and variant information (read-only)
* Inventory levels per location (read-only)
* Store identification information required for authentication

The app does not access customer data, orders, or payment information.

---

## Data Usage

Inventory data is accessed only when a merchant manually initiates a scan inside the app.

During a scan, the app reads variant inventory quantities per location to determine whether items are at zero stock. If a zero-stock condition is detected, an event record is created for tracking purposes.

No automatic scans, background monitoring, or scheduled jobs are performed.

---

## Data Storage

The app stores minimal operational data required for functionality, including:

* Store identifier
* Inventory event records (product ID, variant ID, SKU, vendor, location ID)
* Event timestamps (first seen, last seen, resolved date if restocked)
* Vendor exclusion settings (if configured by the merchant)

This data is used solely to support event history, filtering, and CSV export features.

The app does not store customer personal data.

When the app is uninstalled, associated operational data for the store is deleted.

---

## Data Modification

Baseline Stock Monitor is a read-only app.

It does not modify:

* Inventory quantities
* Products
* Variants
* Orders
* Store settings

---

## Data Sharing

The app does not sell, share, transfer, or disclose store data to third parties.

---

## Security

The app uses Shopify session token authentication and follows Shopify’s app security guidelines. No background data processing or external data sharing occurs.

---
